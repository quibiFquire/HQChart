The textbook is suitable for students who have completed a course in precalculus or have some background in algebra and trigonometry. The authors use a variety of methods to help students grasp the concepts of calculus, such as graphical, numerical, algebraic, verbal, and written explanations. The examples and exercises are designed to challenge students to think critically and creatively about the problems they encounter. The projects provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge to real-world situations and explore topics in depth. The textbook also incorporates the use of technology tools such as graphing calculators, spreadsheets, and computer algebra systems to enhance students' learning experience.
 
Calculus: Single and Multivariable 6th Edition is a well-written and engaging textbook that offers a balanced and rigorous treatment of calculus. It is ideal for students who want to learn calculus from both single-variable and multivariable perspectives and develop a solid foundation for further studies in mathematics, science, engineering, or other fields. The textbook is also accompanied by a range of supplementary materials such as an instructor's manual, a student solutions manual, a test bank, an online homework system, and a companion website. Students who use this textbook will benefit from the authors' expertise and experience in teaching calculus and will gain a deeper appreciation of the beauty and power of calculus.
  
One of the distinctive features of Calculus: Single and Multivariable 6th Edition is the use of real-world data and applications to motivate and illustrate the concepts of calculus. The authors draw examples and exercises from various fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, economics, medicine, engineering, and social sciences. The textbook also includes several case studies that show how calculus can be used to model and solve real-world problems. For instance, in Chapter 3, students learn how to use derivatives to analyze the spread of a disease, the motion of a rocket, the growth of a population, and the behavior of a market. In Chapter 10, students learn how to use integrals to calculate the area of a region, the volume of a solid, the work done by a force, and the arc length of a curve.
 
Another distinctive feature of Calculus: Single and Multivariable 6th Edition is the emphasis on multiple representations and perspectives. The authors encourage students to view calculus from different angles and to switch between different modes of thinking. The textbook uses graphs, tables, equations, words, and symbols to represent the concepts and processes of calculus. The textbook also helps students to make connections between different topics and concepts within calculus and across other disciplines. For example, in Chapter 5, students learn how to relate the concepts of limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In Chapter 11, students learn how to connect the concepts of vectors, dot products, cross products, and matrices using geometric and algebraic interpretations.
 
Calculus: Single and Multivariable 6th Edition is a textbook that aims to help students develop a deep and lasting understanding of calculus. The authors use a variety of strategies and techniques to engage students' interest, curiosity, and creativity. The textbook also fosters students' skills in problem-solving, reasoning, communication, and collaboration. The textbook is designed to support students' learning goals and preferences and to prepare them for future challenges and opportunities. Calculus: Single and Multivariable 6th Edition is a textbook that not only teaches students how to do calculus but also why calculus matters.
