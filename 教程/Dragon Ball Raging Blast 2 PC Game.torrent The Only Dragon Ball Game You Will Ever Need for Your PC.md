Unfortunately, there is no official PC version of Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2, but there is a way to play it using an emulator. An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of another device, allowing you to run games and applications that are not compatible with your system. In this case, you will need an emulator that can run PS3 games on your PC, such as RPCS3.
 
RPCS3 is an open-source PS3 emulator that can run many PS3 games with high compatibility and performance. However, it is not a simple plug-and-play solution. You will need to have a powerful PC, a PS3 game disc or a backup file (ISO), and a PS3 firmware file. You will also need to configure the emulator settings and install some additional software to make the game run smoothly.
 
In this article, we will guide you through the steps to play Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2 on PC using RPCS3. Please note that this method is not endorsed by the game developers or publishers, and may violate their terms of service. You should only use this method if you own a legal copy of the game and the PS3 console.
 
## Step 1: Download and install RPCS3
 
The first step is to download and install RPCS3 on your PC. You can get it from the official website: [https://rpcs3.net/download](https://rpcs3.net/download). Choose the latest version for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or BSD) and extract the zip file to a folder of your choice.
 
Next, run the rpcs3.exe file to launch the emulator. You will see a welcome screen with some information and instructions. Click on "I have read the Quickstart Guide" and then click on "Continue".

## Step 2: Download and install PS3 firmware
 
The next step is to download and install the PS3 firmware file on RPCS3. This file contains the system software of the PS3 console, which is required to run PS3 games on the emulator. You can get it from the official PlayStation website: [https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/). Choose the latest version (4.88 at the time of writing) and download the PS3UPDAT.PUP file.
 
Once you have downloaded the file, go back to RPCS3 and click on "File" > "Install Firmware". Browse to the location where you saved the PS3UPDAT.PUP file and select it. The emulator will start installing the firmware, which may take a few minutes. When it is done, you will see a message saying "Successfully installed PlayStation 3 firmware". Click on "OK".
 
## Step 3: Download and install DirectX and Visual C++ Redistributable
 
The third step is to download and install some additional software that are needed for RPCS3 to run properly. These are DirectX and Visual C++ Redistributable packages, which provide essential libraries and components for graphics and audio processing.
 
You can get DirectX from Microsoft's website: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35). Click on "Download" and run the dxwebsetup.exe file. Follow the instructions to install DirectX on your PC.
 
You can get Visual C++ Redistributable from Microsoft's website: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-443</p> 8cf37b1e13{-string.enter-}
